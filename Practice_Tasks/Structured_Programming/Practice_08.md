## Important Notes

The checkpoint will be graded based on your programs' output, the correctness of your repository structure, and the style of your code. You may be penalized and receive a lower grade if your program's output does not exactly match the expected output (wrong letters, extra spaces or newlines, or an incorrectly computed result). Please check your code and output before submitting your work to GitHub or Moodle. Ensure your program's output matches the specified output on this page. Print a `\n` newline after the final line of your program's output. Format real numbers precisely to the number of decimal places specified in the sample output.

Ensure your code style is consistent: indent code properly, separate logical blocks with a blank line, and use variable names that follow a consistent naming style and concisely describe the data they store. The code style for all files must conform to the configuration in `.clang-format`. By default, `.clang-format` is set to the WebKit style; see the [WebKit Code Style Guidelines](https://webkit.org/code-style-guidelines) for details. If you prefer a different style, update `.clang-format` accordingly. Ensure that your source files adhere to the selected style. If you receive the error `The file is not formatted consistently with the '.clang-format' configuration.` from the grader, it means you failed to follow the selected style in the `.clang-format` file. Format your source code manually or use CLion's autoformatting tools. However, we recommend starting with manual formatting to build good programming habits.

Your files and directories must be named according to the requirements outlined at the bottom of this page. Moreover, your repository must not contain extraneous files or unrelated code, especially within the folder designated for lab tasks.

If you are instructed to use a particular function, you must base your solution on that function, even if a better solution exists without it.

Do not hesitate to contact your practice instructor if you have any questions.

## Homework

Read Introduction to C++ Programming, 3rd Edition by Y. Daniel Liang, Chapter 7, 8

Read, try to understand, and rewrite the following code examples from Chapter 8 as they are:

  1. `PassTwoDimensionalArray.cpp` (name your file `problem01.cpp`)
  2. `GradeExam.cpp` (name your file `problem02.cpp`)
  3. `FindNearestPoints.cpp` (name your file `problem03.cpp`)
  4. `CheckSudokuSolution.cpp` (name your file `problem04.cpp`)
  5. `Weather.cpp` (name your file `problem05.cpp`)

While you can copy and paste the code from the book, it is highly recommended to avoid doing so. Instead, try retyping the code yourself for educational purposes: compile it, run it, and evaluate the flow of execution in a debugger. This practice will help prepare you for the final exam.

## Expected Repository Structure

Upon completion of all assignments, your repository should look like this:

```
. (.idea, .gitignore, .clang-format, CMakeLists.txt, Readme.md)
├── problem01.cpp
├── problem02.cpp
├── problem03.cpp
├── problem04.cpp
├── problem05.cpp
```

If the files with assignments are named incorrectly, you will be penalized.
