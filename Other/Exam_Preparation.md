## COM-119: Object-Oriented Programming

### Midterm

#### Theory

Read the following chapters of the course book:

* Chapter 9: Objects and Classes
* Chapter 10: Object-Oriented Thinking
* Chapter 11: Pointers and Dynamic Memory Management
* Chapter 12: Templates, Vector, and Stack
* Chapter 14: Operator Overloading
* Chapter 16: Exception Handling

#### Practice

Redo labs 1 to 4 and try to implement the following classes in C++ on your own:

* `point2D`
* `point3D`
* `vector2`
* `vector3`
* `vector4`
* `matrix2x2`
* `matrix3x3`
* `complex`
* `queue`
* `vector` (simple version of `std::vector`)

Focus on the following concepts:

* Constructors
* Destructors
* Members (Attributes, Services)
* Encapsulation
* Operator Overloading
* Type Conversion (to and from `string`)
* Exception Handling (`throw`, `try/catch`)

Write `main.cpp` files to test your classes. Know how to instantiate objects, access members, and use operators. Know how to handle exceptions.

### Final

#### Theory

Read the following chapters of the course book:

* Chapter 13: File Input and Output
* Chapter 15: Inheritance and Polymorphism
* Chapter 16: Exception Handling (Custom Exceptions Classes)
* Chapter 17: Recursion

#### Practice

Redo labs 5 to 8 and try to create simple GUI applications with QT to draw 2D shapes such as points, lines, circles, rectangles, and polygons to the screen upon user input (button clicks to select a shape).

Programs like this will be there on the final exam:
