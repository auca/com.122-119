## Problem #1: "Arithmetic Mean" (0.4%)

The application calculates an arithmetic mean for a set of grades (in the range from one to
five). All grades should be read from the standard input one at a time. A zero value signals the end
of the input and is not used in the calculation.

### Sample Input and Output

```
3
4
2
5
0
The arithmetic mean is 3.5
```

```
5
5
4
4
0
The arithmetic mean is 4.5
```

```
0
Nothing to calculate
```

## Problem #2: "Sum of Digits" (0.4%)

Read an integer from the standard input and find the sum of all its digits.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the number: 6427572
The sum of all digits is 33.
```

```
Enter the number: 784
The sum of all digits is 19
```

## Problem #3: "Simple Math Test" (0.4%)

The program asks for a number of tests, generates and prints each test on a separate line, reads each
answer after each line, and provides statistics with a number of correct and incorrect answers at the
end. Each test asks to find a sum of two numbers. In their solutions students have to use the `while`
loop and the `for` loop.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Number of tests? 3
5 + 3 = 8
4 + 2 = 5
-3 + 11 = 9
Number of correct answers: 1
Number of incorrect answers: 2
```

## Problem #4: "Random Circles" (0.4%)

The application draws a certain number of circles of random sizes, at random coordinates, and of random
colors.

### Sample

## Problem #5: "Gradient" (0.4%)

The application draws a number of circles of variant color shades at the center of
the screen.
