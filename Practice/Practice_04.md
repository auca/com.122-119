## Problem #1: "Dangerous Comparison of Double Values" (0.4%)

Create variable `result` of the data type double and assign to it the value 0. Then add 0.1 to it 10 times. Compare the result with 1.0. If the numbers are equal, print "Equal". Otherwise, print "Not equal". Explain the result.

## Problem #2: "Season Name (If-Else If)" (0.4%)

The application determines a season name by a given month number. Use `if-else if` construct to solve the task.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the month number: 12
Winter
```

```
Enter the month number: 3
Spring
```

```
Enter the month number: 100
Invalid month number
```

## Problem #3: "Season Name (Switch-Case)" (0.4%)

Redo the previous solution by using the `switch-case` construct.

## Problem #4: "Experience Level" (0.4%)

The application determines you professional level by a given integer number in a range from
one to five, which represents the complexity level of a certain game.

Conversion table

```
4 <= pro gamer <=5
2 <= experienced gamer<= 3
1 = beginner
0 = total newbie
```

### Sample Input and Output

```
Complexity level: 1
You are a beginner.
```

```
Complexity level: 2
You are an experienced gamer.
```

## Problem #5: "Number of Days" (0.4%)

The application determines a number of days in a specific month for a predefined year.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Year? 2000
Month? 2
Number of days: 29
```
